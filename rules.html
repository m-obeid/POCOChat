    Before you start using your recently created POCOChat account, you need to follow some rules and conditions. These are about 3 very important topics:<br>
    <br>
    I - What you can and cannot use this service for.<br>II - How to behave towards other users of this service<br>III - How collected user information is used<br>
    <br>
    Breaking these rules several times can become an IP-based ban.<br>
    <br>
    This service is offered to you for free by a small developer. This app is not to be abused. Nudity and pornographic content are not allowed. Selling products is also not allowed here. Self-promotion for individuals is allowed as long as it doesn't go too far. Toxic behavior, insulting other users, "doxxing" and other cyber crimes/hyjacks are not allowed. Illegal activities known from the public are of course not welcome here either. Everyone has a free opinion on this platform, and you should always respect what others think.<br>
    <br>
    We want to build a strong, cohesive community. We are nice to each other, we treat others the way we want to be treated.<br>
    <br>
    My app collects very little information. No personal information like your real name or location. Here is the list of everything that is collected:<br>
    <br>
    - IP address to make IP banning possible.<br>- Your browser user agent, this contains the version and name of the operating system, which web browser you are using and sometimes your device model.<br>- Device ID and UUID, these are generated only for POCOChat and do not carry any important info.<br>- Your username and password for POCOChat of course :)<br>
    <br>
    This information is not stored permanently, but serve as a way to search for users in chat, troubleshooting and bug fixing etc....<br>
    <br>
    They are also not shared with any 3rd party but only on the POCOChat database for your account. I will never edit or share this data without your permission.
